This project contains data and code corresponding to the paper:

"Synthetic Data Generation via the Permutation Paradigm
with Optional $k$-Anonymity"

1) There is a Jupyter notebook implementing Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 2.
The code as written is for Algorithm 3. Follow the instructions
in the comments to adapt it to Algorithm 2.

2) Algorithm 1 was implemented in Excel, except the Cholesky decomposition,
whose VBA code is given in "code_algorithm_1_and_metrics_vba_and_sas.docx".

3) Also in "code_algorithm_1_and_metrics_vba_and_sas.docx", SAS codes
for the propensity scores utility measure and the confidentiality
measure are given. The UM utility metric was computed using Excel,
as described in the paper.

4) A original.xlsx file is given that contains the original
data set used in the paper.

5) A synthetic.csv file is given that contains 
synthetic data obtained by the acceptance-rejection 
method in Algorithms 1, 2, and 3.
